Overview
========

This program takes advantage of the SerialUI program mode to provide a dynamically reconfigured graphical user interface for Arduino projects.

Druid4Arduino determines the available commands, menus and sub-menus, and creates a system of menus and buttons that reflect those on the device.

This is a preliminary release, more details available soon.
