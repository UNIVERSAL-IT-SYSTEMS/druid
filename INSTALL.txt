If you have a compiled (binary) version of the program, you can
simply save it anywhere and run it.  There are makefiles for 
compiling the program under Linux (for both Linux and Windows 
binairies) and it should be possible to build the program 
under Windows and Mac relatively easily (though I haven't 
done this and would appreciate feedback/input/help).

See makefiles/README.txt for details.
