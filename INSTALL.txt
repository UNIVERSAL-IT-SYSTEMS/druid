If you have a compiled (binary) version of the program, you can
simply save it anywhere and run it.  There are makefiles for 
compiling the program under Linux (for both Linux and Windows 
binairies) and it should be possible to build the program 
under Windows and Mac relatively easily (though I haven't 
done this and would appreciate feedback/input/help).

See makefiles/README.txt for details, short version is:

	make -f makefiles/Makefile.linux

for Linux compilation.

Requirements
============

To compile this program, you'll need to have a number of dependencies installed.  You'll need:

	* The boost libraries (http://www.boost.org)
	* WxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org/)
	* The SerialUI source code (http://flyingcarsandstuff.com/projects/serialui/)

You'll probably be able to get the first two as pre-compiled packages, for your Linux distro, though I had some trouble getting things working with CygWin under Windows (got it working under linux though, which is how I compiled the Win versions--see http://flyingcarsandstuff.com/2013/03/adventures-of-a-linux-guy-building-windows-programs/)

The makefile is configured to search for the SerialUI includes in the same parent directory as the source you're building here (in ../SerialUI/includes) -- you can dump the source there, or change the makefile.

Enjoy, get in touch if you have any issues (http://flyingcarsandstuff.com/contact/)
